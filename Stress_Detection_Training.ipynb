"Nursing is a high-pressure profession where prolonged stress leads to burnout and medical errors. This project leverages Artificial Intelligence to monitor physiological biomarkers in real-time, providing an early-warning system for healthcare workers."

The Technical Solution
"I developed a Deep Neural Network (DNN) capable of classifying human stress states with high precision. By processing multi-sensor telemetry data—including Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Heart Rate (HR), and Skin Temperature—the model distinguishes between Baseline (Normal), Acute Stress, and High Physical Activity."
